	* tts-api.texi (Speech Synthesis Commands): Position 0 for defer()
	means ''start where speech was interrupted''. This is necessary
	for synthesizers who support multilevel pause but don't support
	index marking.

	* tts-api.texi (Speech Synthesis Commands): say_text, say_deferred now
	accept no position arguments. Separate functions say_text_from_position
	are now supplied for this purpose. This is more consistent with the
	other say and defer functions.
	(Speech Synthesis Commands): say_ functions now don't return 0 as
	message_id_t meaning "not supported". Having a valid message_id_t
	is crucial for audio retrieval and as such must be emulated even
	if index marking and defer() are not supported.
	(Speech Control Commands): defer() no longer returns message_id
	as it is unnecessary.

	* tts-api.texi (Speech Control Commands): There is no
	upper limit on the number of messages postponed through
	defer() except for system resources or configuration
	by the administrator.
	(Speech Control Commands): Note the need to discard()
	previously deferred messages after the application doesn't
	need them any more.
	(Speech Synthesis Commands): say_char: Argument changed
	from wchar_t* to wchar_t.
	(General Points): The word 'string' means a null terminated
	array in C.
	(General Points): Clarification of use of char* and wchar_t.
	(Speech Synthesis Commands): If position is in the middle of
	a tag, start with the text following the tag. If position
	is in the middle of a word, start right there or with the
	beginning of the word.

	* tts-api.texi (Voice Selection): set_voice_by_properties
	only selects a voice under the current driver.
	(Voice Selection): Speak of Unicode instead of UTF-8
	character range.
	(Voice Selection): set_voice_by_properties: all fields
	can be left blank *except language*
	(Voice Selection): set_voice_by_properties: specified
	what `blank field' means.
	(Speech Synthesis Driver Discovery): list_drivers, list_voices returns
	newly allocated null-terminated array.
	(Speech Synthesis Commands): SSML errors are not reported.
	(Speech Synthesis Commands): say_text_from_character(): new function.
	(Requirements on the API): UTF-8 changed to Unicode.

	* API description written.
	
	* ChangeLog starts, this is not the first version of the document
	however. This document was previously discussed	and developed
	in plain text form on the mailing list accessibility@freedesktop.org
	for considerable time by various Free Software accessibility groups.
	Discussions and developement are to be continued on Freedesktop.
